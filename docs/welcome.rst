Getting Started with the Dynex SDK
=====================================
Introduces the Dynex Neuromorphic Computing Platform and the Dynex SDK, describes the basics of how it works, and explains with simple examples how to use it to solve problems and how to use it for Machine Learning.

You can also join the `Dynex workspace on Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/dynex-workspace/shared_invite/zt-22eb1n4mo-aXS5zsUBoPs613Dofi8Q4A>`_ to learn more and to interact with the developer community.
