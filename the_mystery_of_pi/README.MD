# The Mystery of Pi

Pi is a mathematical mystery that has captivated people for thousands of years. There’s even a holiday dedicated to this mystery—Pi Day, which falls on 3/14. People all over the world [celebrate Pi Day in numbers ways](https://www.rd.com/list/ways-to-celebrate-pi-day/), from cracking pi jokes and cashing in on Pi Day deals to learning more about the never-ending number.

## People have been using pi for thousands of years

Pi (the Greek letter π, pronounced like the word “pie”) is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to the diameter of that circle, explains math instructor Steven Bogart in Scientific American. It equals roughly 3.14. No matter what size a circle is, the circumference will always be 3.14 times bigger than the diameter. Over 4,000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians had figured out this constant and were using it to make calculations. In the 18th century, mathematicians gave the number the name “pi.”

## Pi is a never-ending number

One of the most well-known (but still mind-blowing) facts about pi that it is an irrational number. It can’t be expressed as a fraction; it doesn’t end with a repeating pattern (like the decimal expression of 1/3, 0.33333…, in which the threes repeat forever), or terminate after a certain number of decimal places (like 3/4, or .75). It just keeps going, going and going. So far, pi has been calculated to 100 trillion digits, thanks to Google Cloud.
